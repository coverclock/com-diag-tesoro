# Abstract

Tesoro is an application of OpenStreetMaps (OSM), an open-source
alternative to Google Maps. Its purpose is to integrate my own
geolocation software with OSM for the purposes of visualizing geolocation
data streams either in real-time, or as collected and played back. Tesoro
includes both client-side and server-side JavaScript code (see disclaimer
above). The client-side code uses the Leaflet 1.7.1 JavaScript library
(see link below) and an OSM tile (map segment) server. The tile server
runs under Ubuntu on a Raspberry Pi. Tesoro processes geolocation data
represented in JavaScript Object Notation (JSON) form, and visualizes
it in a static or moving-map display using a web browser.

My geolocation datasets were generated in a simple Comma Separated Value
(CSV) format, intended to be easily imported into a spreadsheet. This
data was generated in real-time using "gpstool", an application that is
part of my Hazer project.  Hazer, and its gpstool Swiss Army Knife, is
a project to process the output of Global Navigation Satellite System
(GNSS) and Inertial Measurment Unit (IMU) devices. Hazer includes
applications that convert the data in CSV format generated by gpstool
into JSON and other useful forms.  Hazer has also formed the basis of
several other projects: Tumbleweed (high accuracy Differential GNSS),
and Yodel (integrated GNSS and IMU).

Hazer is built on top of another of my projects, Diminuto, a C-based
systems programming library.

Most of my Hazer work has been hosted on Raspberry Pis running Raspbian,
both for the mobile rover units that collect the GNSS and IMU data in
the field, and for a fixed base stations that transmits differential
corrections. My OSM tile server is also hosted on a Raspberry Pi, running
Ubuntu Linux, with a two terabyte (2TB) Solid State Disk (SSD) in additon
to its root 128GB SD card. The visualization portion of Tesoro has been
tested with FireFox on a x86_64 Ubuntu system, and with FireFox, Chrome,
and Safari on a x86_64 Macintosh running MacOS Catalina.

# Architecture

Tesoro follows the Model-View-Controller (MVC) pattern. Although all of the
components could run on the same computer, I typically run them on three
different computers to simulate how I imagine this might be used in an
actual application.

The Model is the OSM tile server, a software stack and database that
resides on an Apache web server.

The View can be any modern web browser that can run Tesoro's "movingmap"
JavaScript program. I have tested Tesoro using Firefox on a x86_64 system
running Ubuntu, and Firefox, Chrome, and Safari on a Mac running MacOS.

The Controller is the source of the geolocation data and hence steers
the visualization. It is implemented as Tesoro's "channel" JavaScript
program that runs under Node.js. The channel program receives geolocation
data as datagrams in JavaScript Object Notation (JSON) form over User
Datagram Protocol (UDP). It stands up a trivial web server that responds
to any HyperText Transfer Protocol (HTTP) request with the latest JSON
datagram that it has received over the Transmission Control Protocol
(TCP) return path.

In my testing, a fourth component, the Rover, stands in for an actual
geolocating device in the field by playing back geolocation data
previously collected and stored in the Comma Separated Value (CSV) form
used by Hazer's gpstool, and transmitting it as datagrams in JSON form
to the Controller.

In my environment I use a Raspberry Pi 4B as the Model, It runs Ubuntu,
and is equipped with a two terabyte (2TB) Solid State Disk (SSD). The
SSD currently hosts the OpenStreetMaps map data and database for North
America. The host name of the Model will be used in the Uniform Resource
Locator (URL) examples below. A typical View is the Chrome browser
used on a Mac running MacOS. A typical Controller is one of my x86_64
development servers running Ubuntu. A typical Rover is a Raspberry Pi 3B+
running Raspbian, which is what I have used as my field unit in much of
my Hazer work.

# Examples

Tesoro's movingmap JavaScript program can be invoked by several different
web pages.

## Base

The base page renders a static map centered the coordinates of my
Differential GNSS base station coordinates. This is a quick way to tell
of the tile server is working from any computer on the same network.

    http://modelhost/tesoro/base.html

## Query

The query page takes a query URL containing the following fields: a name
identifying the data source (NAM), a monotonically increasing counter
(NUM), the GPS solution time in UTC represented in the number of seconds
since the POSIX epoch (TIM), latitude (LAT) and longitude (LON) in decimal
degrees, the altitude above mean sea level in meters (MSL), and a label
(LBL) to be applied to the mark marker. The query page renders a static
map centered on the specified coordinates.  an easy way to view a static
map from any computer on the same network.

    http://modelhost/tesoro/query.html?NAM=hostname&NUM=1&TIM=1599145249&LAT=39.7943071&LON=-105.1533805&MSL=1710.300&&LBL=2020-09-03T15:00:49Z

## Select Channel

The selectchannel page renders a moving map from JSON dynamically
generated in real-time, provided by a server-side JavaScript-based web
server, identified via a URL entered by the user.

    http://modelhost/tesoro/selectchannel.html

A typical Select Channel test set up is as follows. 

Install the client-side Tesoro HTML and JavaScript programs on the Model
tile server, which runs Apache. If this weren't all behind my firewall, I
could modify the client-side movingmap JavaScript to use any tile server.
But right now it assumes the tile server is on the same computer as the
script itself.

Run the Hazer "tesoroselectchannel" script on the Rover host. This converts
a forty-five minute (45m) CSV dataset of an actual Hazer test into JSON
and meters it out at approximately its original rate as datagrams to the
UDP port defined in /etc/services as "tesoro". This simulates a mobile
GNSS device generating data in the field and forwarding the datagrams
to a remote UDP port. I could just as easily substitute an actual rover
in the field, sending data over an LTE modem (and have done so before
Tesoro existed, using Google Earth as the visualization part). Direct
the script to the appropriate host and UDP service (port), replacing
"channelhost" with the actual host name.

    tesoroselectchannel channelhost:tesoro

Run the Tesoro "channel" script, which runs the "channel" JavaScrip
program using Node.js), on the Controller host.  This serves as the
interface between the rover in the field (or the playback that pretends
to be a rover) and the client-side movingmap program running in the
visualization browser. The script takes two arguments, a UDP service
(port) on which to receive datagrams, and a TCP service (port) on which
to receive HTTP requests via TCP. Since the incoming port uses UDP and
the outgoing port uses TCP, they can have the same name.

    channel tesoro tesoro

Pull up a browser on the View host, and point it to the "selectchannel"
page on the Model tile server. The URL will look like this

	http://modelhost/tesoro/selectchannel.html

replacing "modelhost" with the hostname of the tile server. When the
popup asks for the channel name, type in the URL for the Controller host
on which the channel script is running

	http://controllerhost:22020/channel.json

where 22020 is the tesoro TCP port number. The JavaScript code will start
reading the JSON geolocation data from the channel, and using Leaflet
to access tiles (map segments) from the OSM tile server, render them,
creating a moving map display. You can click on the pointer that is
kept centered on the map and see a UTC timestamp for when the data was
originally collected.

# Dependencies

I used Ubuntu 20.04 rather than the Raspberry Pi OS (formerly known
as Raspbian). (Prior to this project, I didn't even know you could run
Ubuntu on an RPi; never the less, I'll likely be sticking to Raspbian for
my other projects.) The instructions to install Ubuntu on the Raspberry
Pi can be found below. In addition to these instructions, there was a
substantial about of configuration necessary to integrated the RPi into
my environment; your mileage may vary.

<https://ubuntu.com/tutorials/how-to-install-ubuntu-on-your-raspberry-pi>

The directions below detail how to install an OSM tile server on Ubuntu
20.04. They were straightforward, but due to the amount of data involved
- the North American map dataset alone is over ten gigabytes (and the
world map dataset is over a terabyte) - this is a very lengthy process.

<https://switch2osm.org/serving-tiles/manually-building-a-tile-server-20-04-lts/>

The install target in the Tesoro Makefile uses the Node.js terser program
to minimize the client-side JavaScript code.

    npm install terser -g

My client-side JavaScript code uses the version 1.7.1 of the Leaflet
library.  The Tesoro Makefile can automatically fetch this distro,
unzip it, and install it on the web server (providing it has the right
permissions).
